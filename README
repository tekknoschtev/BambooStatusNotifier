BAMBOO STATUS NOTIFIER
==============================
The Bamboo Status Notifier is designed to provide an entertaining and easy
way to notify the team of the current status of the bamboo build.  Based on
specified criteria, certain events can be triggered with the Arduino.  For
example, when the build fails, a Red light could flash along with a negative
sounding tone.

FUNCTIONALITY
==============================
bamboobuildchecker.py --
  The python script is scheduled to run every 10 seconds.  It fetches the
  Bamboo log page for the SfS Test build, and parses the page looking for
  specific strings of text.  The currently configured scenarios are:
    - Successful build
    - Failed build
    - Currently building
  Once the script detects one of the listed conditions, it writes a 
  character to the specified serial port.

bambooBuildChecker.ino --
  The arduino script is running in a constant loop reading from the serial
  port.  Once it reads one of the pre-defined characters, certain actions 
  are triggered.  The currently actions are as follows:
    - Successful build:
        Turn on one LED
    - Currently building
        Flash a LED
    - Build failed
        Turn on a different LED and play a depressing tone

SETUP
==============================
The only configuration change needed in order for this project to function
on any host machine is the serial port; currently it's configured to COM3.
